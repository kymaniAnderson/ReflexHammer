# ReflexHammer
This is an Arduino project. The aim is to collect displacement and acceleration of the leg during the knee jerk reaction while using an EMG to plot an EMG graph. The force of the hammer is also collected for reference.

 
### Aim: Investigate the relationship between a digital reflex hammer data, muscle activity in the leg and displacement of the leg during knee jerk reaction.
### Procedure:
1.   Design and construct prototypes for an electromyogram (EMG) and a digital reflex hammer that can collect data simultaneously.
2.   Record the displacement of the leg when the knee is stimulated by the reflex hammer.
3.   Data must be collected from at least 8 subjects.
4.   Discuss the application of the device in the medical diagnosis and/or research.
